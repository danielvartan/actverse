Have an idea for a new `actverse` feature? Take a look at the
[documentation](https://danielvartan.github.io/actverse) and [issue
list](https://github.com/danielvartan/actverse/issues) to see if it
isn’t included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue
on GitHub](https://github.com/danielvartan/actverse/issues). While we
can’t promise to implement your idea, it helps to:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible.

See below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.

### Report a Bug 🐛

Using `actverse` and discovered a bug? That’s annoying! Don’t let others
have the same experience and report it as an [issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/danielvartan/actverse/issues/new) so we can
fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please
include:

- The content of
  [`utils::sessionInfo()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/sessionInfo.html).
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in
  troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug (Tip: Use the
  [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package).

### Improve the Documentation 📖

Noticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better
example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to
improve it is very welcome!

#### The Website

The [website](https://danielvartan.github.io/actverse) is generated with
[`pkgdown`](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). That means we don’t have to
write any HTML: Content is pulled together from documentation in the
code, vignettes,
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
files, the package `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml` settings. If you
know your way around `pkgdown`, you can [propose a file
change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/)
to improve documentation.

#### Function Documentation

Functions are described as comments near their code and translated to
documentation using [`roxygen2`](https://klutometis.github.io/roxygen/).
If you want to improve a function description:

1.  Go to `R/` directory in the [code
    repository](https://github.com/danielvartan/actverse).
2.  Look for the file with the function.
3.  [Propose a file
    change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/)
    to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments
    (starting with `#'`).

## Development Guidelines

We follow the [GitHub
Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development.
This means all changes should be made in feature branches, submitted as
pull requests, and reviewed before merging into the main branch. Please
keep your branches focused on a single topic or fix to make reviews
easier and the project history clearer. Here are the steps to follow:

1.  Fork [this repo](https://github.com/danielvartan/actverse) and clone
    it to your computer. To learn more about this process, see [this
    guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).
2.  If you have forked and cloned the project before, and it has been a
    while since you worked on it, [pull changes from the original
    repo](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/)
    to your clone by using `git pull upstream main`.
3.  Open the project in RStudio or other IDE of your choice.
4.  Make your changes:
    - Write your code.
    - Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).
    - Document your code (see function documentation above).
    - Check your code with `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors,
      warnings, and notes.
5.  Commit and push your changes.
6.  Submit a [pull
    request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).

Please ensure your code adheres to the [tidyverse design
guide](https://principles.tidyverse.org/) and the [tidyverse style
guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). All contributions should follow
these principles and conventions to maintain consistency and readability
throughout the project.
