\title{Non-Parametric Function M10 (Most Active 10 Hours)}
\usage{
npcra_m10(data, col_activity = "pim", timestamp = "timestamp", method = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataframe that contains the date column and the column that
will be used to identify the 10 most active hours.}

\item{col_activity}{String with the name of the column that will be used in the
calculation. The observations in this column must be in numeric format.}

\item{timestamp}{String with the name of the column that contains the date
and time of each observation (POSIX format).}

\item{method}{An integer that represents one of the three common methods for
calculating and analyzing M10:

1 = whole period,

2 = average day,

3 = each day.

If you prefer you can also directly call the functions npcra_m10_whole_period,
npcra_m10_average_day or npcra_m10_each_day.}
}
\value{
A Dataframe with the value of M10 in the first position and the start
date of the 10 most active window in the period in the second position.
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\out{<a href='https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental'><img src='figures/lifecycle-experimental.svg' alt='Experimental lifecycle'></a>}}{\strong{Experimental}}

M10 is calculated by identifying the 10-hour window with the highest activity in
the given period.

The function calculates the averages of a quantitative variable
(typically the representative of the activity in the data set) in an interval
that comprises each observation until the end of a 10-hour window, moving on
to the next observation with the same approach. Note that the accuracy of the
M10 is related to the validity of the given data range.
