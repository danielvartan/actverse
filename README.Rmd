## Overview

`actverse` is an R package that provides a complete and consistent toolkit to process, analyze and visualize actigraphy data in R. The aim of `actverse` is to facilitate the work of sleep and chronobiology scientists with actigraphy data while also helping with research reproducibility.

> Please note that this package is currently on the development stage and have not yet been [peer reviewed](https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html).

## Prerequisites

You only need to have some familiarity with the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) to use the `actverse` main functions.

In case you don't feel comfortable with R, we strongly recommend checking Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's free and online book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and the Coursera course from the John Hopkins University [Data Science: Foundations using R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r) (free for audit students).

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gipso/actverse")
```

## Citation

If you use `actverse` in your research, please consider citing it. We put a lot of work to build and maintain a free and open-source R package. You can find the `actverse` citation below.

```{r}
citation("actverse")
```
